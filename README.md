# Purpose and object
_Initial Rust_ is my own encyclopedia of the Rust programming language. 
I'll keep my own notes here to keep everything centralized and accessible from anywhere.

# References
To take these notes I followed the following official and open source guidelines:
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html

# Uses
Feel free to use and consult whatever you need. 
My intentions are limited to my own learning and contribution to the Rust community.
